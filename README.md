### Main Features:

#### Pre-packaged

The pre-market reveals the stocks with the greatest volume and reveals upward gaps (gap up) or downward gaps (gap down). This early insight is essential for intraday trading, providing a privileged look at market dynamics before the open. By understanding which assets are gaining or losing strength, investors can make more informed decisions and capitalize on potential opportunities.

#### Buy Box

Our advanced 'BuyBox' alert system accurately detects when stocks are experiencing a notable capital injection. Through a visual representation in the volume column, which varies in colors from lower to higher shades, we identify clear bullish reversal opportunities in the stock market. This cutting-edge scanner provides solid and timely signals for taking bullish positions, allowing investors to strategically take advantage of growth trends. With 'BuyBox,' investors can make informed decisions and maximize their earning potential in the dynamic world of investing.
